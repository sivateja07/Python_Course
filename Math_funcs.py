import math 
x = - 3.9
y = 5
print(round(x)) #roudns to nearby integer
print(abs(x)) #returns the postive value (just like modulus in maths)#

#now what OODP in general is take a look at the example here we have math#
#In general it is a string but this string is an object where it has all the fucntions ceil, round, abs, sin and in built fucntions that can be used here#
#like wise we can create a file as an object and inherit all of its fucntions into a new code just like inheriting all the fucntions into the next file and making the app#

print(math.ceil(x)) #notice here we have to use the object and . operator to provoke its functions#
print(math.factorial(y))
